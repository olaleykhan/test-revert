          <p>Legends aren’t defined by their success, they are defined by how they bounce back from their failures.
            We all have a story to tell, as a matter of fact I would say adulthood is a very big scam, like nobody prepared me for this shit, nobody handed me a manual, I can remember how badly I wanted to become an adult as a kid, I would look forward to it everyday, day-dream, even count down to when I can officially call myself one.
            If only I knew with great powers or should I say freedom in this case comes great responsibilities.. in summary ‘I never expected adulthood to feel look and be this way’ but oh well guess I gotta master and slay being an adult to the best of my abilities . </p>

          <p>happiness is a thing that comes from within, it just has to else you are headed for the black hole ‘depression’.
            funny how i never knew the importance of having ‘peace of mind’ but that’s the top 3 of my wish-list, see you can’t function properly without the state of having a clear mind, that’s why it is very important at all cost to protect our mental health, happiness and peace of mind, these are the secret to a healthy state of being, don’t get me wrong there are other factors involved..like eating healthy, sleeping properly, good spritual hygienic practices etc </p>
